### About myself
I'm a good team player who have leader qualities. I
pay attentive to details and try to be extremely helpful
in my time management. My main pros is a
responsibility. I also prefer to investigate new
technologies and proccesses and develop my skills.

What about my expirience?

At the moment I am working as a QA engineer and have over one and a half years of experience in the company. During my work, I managed to work with functional and non-functional testing. In particular, I had to test the operation of the API for the interaction of microservices, as well as conduct UI / UX testing of the functionality displayed on the landing pages.

Why front-end development?

I'm interested in how interface elements interact, how pages make requests to display a particular element. In addition, I like the dynamism of pages and I would like to take part in the development of such functionality in order to visually observe my work
